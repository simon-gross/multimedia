# TL;DR
Collection of codes for creation of materials for a cartography and data-vizualisation university project.

# Description
For a university project we had to create a short animated story that can be displayed on a tactile hyperglobe display.

Using Twitter data, we created a ~5 min animation, describing how Twitter can be used to gain insights about spatial phenomena. Examples are the Twitter response during the midterm elections in the United States in 2022 and the 
appointment of Rishi Sunak as the prime minister of the United Kingdom and the subsequent worldwide reaction using the hashtag #RishiSunak. 

The project uses python to create the frames for the animation, since the story is very data-heavy
and using geopandas and matplotlib works well to create the different frames.

The end of the story also shows a live animation of tweets all around the world.

This repo contains a collection of small (sometimes unifinished) scripts that creates the animations / frames for the story. The different materials where than stiched together using the software [OmniSuite](https://globoccess.com/de).
